Profile Website

Introduction
This portfolio website is my second assignment for the mentorship program with Sofia. The task was to utilize CSS to style an existing HTML page.

Website Overview
This website showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. The website is divided into several sections:

Header Section
The introduction is displayed using the H1 tag, which reads "Meet Mark Ohio."

Theme Toggle
A light mode and dark mode button were created using JavaScript(sourced online), HTML, and CSS, allowing users to switch between themes.

Profile Section
The profile section features an avatar image accompanied by a brief description of the user.

Favorite Activities Section
A list of favorite activities is presented in dropdown boxes. Each activity has a brief description that can be read by clicking on the respective dropdown.

This section contains buttons linking to various social media platforms.

Footer Section
The footer section provides additional information and copyright details.
